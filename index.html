            <p class="light">With more and more children in the village needing Paskalina’s support and wanting to attend the daycare, the conditions for learning were rapidly becoming less and less ideal. With 40+ children in one small room, very limited resources and facilities and a severe lack of space, the children’s learning was being impacted. Some volunteers also found their placement at Power the Children difficult and were regularly requesting to move to other placements, causing further issues for Paskalina and the children. Furthermore, the sustainability of the help being provided by volunteers was in question. Volunteers who came with the intention of helping would find themselves purchasing items like books, stationary, backpacks, clothing, tables and chairs, food, painting the classroom, etcetera. Over time, Paskalina found herself with an abundance of these items and eventually it became clear that initiatives needed to become sustainable and long term, to ever have a real positive impact. The need for more space and proper facilities was clear!

          <p class="left-align light">In 2017, the incredible Dayna Roy travelled to Arusha as a volunteer, and was placed at Power the Children, and quickly fell in love with the school and Paskalenas passion for the children's welfare and education. Understanding the challenges Paskalena and the children faced every day, with the lack of ability to learn in an adequate environment, Dayna and Paskalena started a project to buy land and build a school. Shortly following in 2018, Lucy also travelled to Tanzania, and also fell in love with Power the Children, jumping on board with the project. Leena came on board during her time volunteering in December 2018, and we each became interconnected with a common goal of providing the children with a functioning learning space for each child, and many more. <br><br> A wonderful woman named McCrea contacted us shortly after purchasing the initial block of land in early 2018. Her foundation, Team Nelson donated $10,000 USD to begin building the new school! Although it was a long journey, it was all thanks to  the help of many incredible people along the way. In January of 2020, Dayna, Leena and Lucy each travelled to Tanzania to meet for the first time, and be a part of the official opening ceremony of the school. </p>

          <p class="left-align light">For the Three of us, this third trip was a catalyst moment in the formation of the official ‘Powers Project Foundation PTY LTD’. Upon our arrival in Tanzania for the opening ceremony, we were met with both achievement and a wealth of new challenges, within the project moving forward, and learning curves from previous months. We realised the need for an official NGO to be able to continue with such projects for the longevity of success.  

            <br><br>Through further exploration of establishing educational systems abroad, and evaluating how ‘good development’ is achieved, we collectively came to the ideological basis for The Powers Project Foundation.

          <p class="left-align light">Education remains a fundamental building block in each individual's life, and their chances for success, as well as in an entire country's development, both economically and socially. It is statistically proven that education has profound impacts on all areas of society, from the ability to work, to improvements in modern medicine and even with empowering women and lowering birth rates. <br><br>

            Unfortunately for many people around the world, in various communities, education and schooling is not always readily available. Many children are unable to attend schooling due to distance issues, family issues, financial difficulties and a lack of resources. The Powers Project Foundation works towards closing the gap, and ensuring as many children around the world have the chance at an education, and the chance at a future. <br><br>
            
            We do this by fundraising and working directly with local people to either purchase already constructed spaces, or purchase land and construct schools. Upon completion of the project, The Powers Project Foundation, then continues its support through management of the facilities and funding the running costs of the schools, including food for the children, power, water, transportation, general maintenance, etc. <br><br>
            
            Another key element within The Powers Project Foundation, is the way in which our Schools run, and the curriculum the children work towards. Through our time volunteering abroad, it quickly became apparent that the way in which we may do things in a western country, will almost never work in another, due to cultural differences and community needs. We recognise the importance of empowering the cultures in which we work in, and ensuring our schools teach towards the direct needs of the community and children, opposed to trying to ‘recreate western style schooling and development’. However, in saying this, sharing knowledge is vital for success, and therefore our school curriculums are formulated with the help of educators from all different parts of the world, especially local teachers, and various educational backgrounds. <br><br>
            
            We also aim to ensure our schools are self-sufficient and sustainable, therefore, much of the curriculum and activities are based on using resources which are readily available in each community. For example, we focus on recycling initiatives at the schools for both environmental reasons and to be used as mathematics resources, or using the natural elements in the area, such as sand, to have the children practice letter formation.
