      <h2 class="center header">Where and Why Arusha?</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col s6">
          <p>Arusha is a city located in the Northern region of the stunning East African country, Tanzania. Arusha is a smaller sized city, with a population of approximately 500,000 people, and it is nestled amongst thick greenery and mountains, where it sits at the base of Mt Meru. Arusha is considered the ‘gateway’ city to some of Africas most sought after Safari destinations, including the Serengetti, Tarangire National Park and the Ngorongoro Crater, as well as the world's highest free standing peak, Mt Kilimanjaro. ‘Arusha is a colourful city with quite a fun and bustling culture, where a sense of community, and love of music and dance.’ </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col s6">
          <p>Arusha can be considered the ‘place of birth’ of The Powers project Foundation, as this is the place where Leena, Lucy and Dayna each volunteered, and began working together through fundraising for ‘Power the Children Primary School’. Having experience in working in Arusha will play a vital role in the success of this project as we are able to apply our acquired skills, knowledge and understanding of the problem to this project. 

            Because of the access Arusha has to some of Africa's most incredible destinations, the majority of tourists look past local life, and only travel through the city for a very short period of time, before and after their Safari trips or climbing Mt Kilimanjaro. For local people, who have been fortunate enough to complete their education, gaining employment in the Tourism sector is strongly desired, as the Tourism industry is the main economic driver in Arusha.

        </div>
        <div class="col s6">
          <p>The reality is that despite having a strong tourism sector, and economic growth due to other means, Tanzania is still one of the most impoverished countries in the world, where approximately 36% of the population lives below the poverty line. Along with this high percentage of people living below the poverty line, according to the World Bank, the average GDP per capita as of 2018, sits at only $1050 USD ("GDP per capita (current US$) | Data", 2020). </p>

      <h2 class="center header">Education</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <p>Tanzania has made great progress both economically and within education, achieving nearly universal primary education in 2007. Unfortunately since 2007, the number of students in Primary Education has declined, with an estimated 2 million children between the ages of 7-13 out of school. Along with this, the quality of education is low, due to a number of factors including unqualified teachers, lack of resources, in-adiquate learning spaces, socio-economic factors, and health factors. Children from a young age are often taught through ‘rote learning’ and are expected to be able to grasp the concept of numbers, letters, addition, and so forth from ages as young as 2 years old! To make some of these challenges even more difficult, there is little information about disability in children, and trauma in children, making children in these vulnerable circumstances even less likely to attend school and succeed.</p>

            <td>
              <p>First and foremost, The Powers Project Foundation has a basic model of providing education to the poorer families in Arusha, therefore education at our schools is free. Children who attend our schools do not pay for school levies, uniforms, materials, transportation to and from school, lunches, and so forth. </p>

            <td>
              <p>Another focal point in our mantra, is to ensure our schools are both locally sustainable and they teach based on the community and cultural practices. The curriculum for our schools have been constructed through input from a range of education professionals both abroad, and in Tanzania. Through shared knowledge, our curriculum uses both methods from the local way of teaching, to ensure our students have some familiarity, and are able to meet the requirements of the local education system, along with other education methods, including play based learning in the early years, and enquiry based learning.

              <p>We aim to strengthen the local community and maintain strong culture within our schools. We don't want to put a ‘western school’ in Tanzania, we want to create an incredible Tanzanian school, where children learn about their country, their culture and their direct needs. We focus on empowering all our students through educating them about equality, women's empowerment, sexual education, HIV, local environmental factors, and other local factors. Children in Africa have a rhythm like no other, and absolutely love learning through music and dance, so it is guaranteed that at some point each day, the classroom transforms into a party!

            </td>
            <td>
              <p>We also aim to have our schools be fully self sustainable, in terms of resources. Children learn best using materials that are familiar to them, therefore the resources we use in our schools are all locally acquired and recycled. Of course we use books, pencils, rulers, etc, but we do aim to have a recycling initiative where for example; children and teachers can reuse items such as bottle caps, or even dried beans as mathematics counters. We aim to establish a large veggie garden the school can use to provide the children with lunches, and even the playground will be created from locally recycled items, such as tractor tyres. This is to create a play area where children can move items, create new areas to play, imagine, and learn about risk taking.

    <h3 class="center header">Final Statement</h5>
    <p>We are starting from the early years and working our way up. Children are at their most vital stages of learning when they are young, hence why we are first developing a pre-primary facility, then Primary, and then Secondary. We want to ensure that all the children receive a full education, and can complete their studies right up until their final years.
    </p>
    <p>Tanzania is such an incredible place, with an incredible culture! Development does not mean creating a ‘western style society’, Development means strengthening the local culture and community, based on their needs and wants in order to ease the gap of poverty and human rights.
