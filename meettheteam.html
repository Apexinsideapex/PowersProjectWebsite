        <h4> Leena Vasishta </h4>
        <p>Mambo! My Name is Leena Vasishta, I am not very good at writing about myself so I'll just narrate a story.</p>
        <p>I volunteered at the Power the Children foundation from December 2018 - Feb 2019 and it absolutely changed my life. From stepping off the plane to being welcomed with open arms into Paskalina’s life and home was amazing. 
          I was blown away by how friendly and giving the community was.
          </p>
          <p>A typical day would be something like this:<br>
            We would head to Mbauda in the morning, we would then be greeted by Paskalina at the door with the warmest hug and she would sit us down and brew us this delicious ginger tea. We would start planning our day and going over our to-do lists. We would then head into the classrooms and be greeted by the huge grins of our children. The next few hours would be spent engaging with them using interactive learning techniques and teaching them a little English as well. Few days a week we would head out to the new school and get some things done. We would end each day extremely exhausted, but with cheek to cheek grins and full hearts. 
            </p>
            <p>
              My time in Africa was an emotional rollercoaster. My heart has never been as full as it is on this beautiful continent. There have been lows as well, and the lows can be so devastating but they end up giving us more purpose and making us work harder towards our goals. I learnt a lot of lessons here. 
I was left with feeling very grateful about my life, but also slightly envious of this beautiful community that I’d been welcomed into, and that I would soon be leaving.

I came here slightly nervous and not really knowing what to expect, and left with an extremely heavy heart, but having added many more members to my family.

            </p>
            <p>I am a big believer in education being a very important part of the foundation of a child. This is exactly what we hope to achieve through The Powers Project. We are aiming to make education more accessible to young kids, so we can set them up to lead a full, successful life.

        <h4> Lucy Obod </h4>
        <p>My name is Lucy, and I am currently in my second year at University, studying a Bachelors of Government and International Relations. My love for travel and in particular, Africa, started when I was only 6 years old, listening to the stories of my uncles travels there, and looking through endless photo albums. Working in development has been a long time dream of mine, and I feel so fortunate to already be a part of global work, and being able to learn what truly ‘good development’ is, along with its many challenges and differences. </p>
        <p>My journey first started as a volunteer in Tanzania in April of 2018, as my first solo trip abroad. I was lucky enough to be given a piece of inheritance, from one of the most beautiful surrogate family members, and without hesitation, I booked my first trip. Despite initial fears and doubt in my ability to travel to an East African country alone at 18, I hopped on the plane, and the course of my life changed drastically. 
        </p>
        <p>Upon arrival in Arusha, I was originally placed at one pre-primary school, however during orientation, as our coordinator Emma explained The Powers Project, I knew that was exactly where I wanted to be. Lucky for me a whole range of factors led me to quickly be placed at Power the Children and I was able to meet the incredible Paskalina Joseph. Instantly, she was welcoming and made me feel a part of her family, which was great because ever since, I have been fortunate enough to have many unique experiences, such as African weddings and crazy adventures. During my time at Power of the Children, I learnt lots about a project started by Dayna Roy in 2017, to buy land and build a two classroom school, just outside the city, in the village of Kisongo. I quickly learnt how un-qualified i was in the field of teaching, and as i was very wary about the potential pitfalls of ‘volunteer tourism’, i removed myself from working directly in the classroom and began focusing on becoming a part of the project.</p>
        <p>After this first trip, I began to organize a few school fundraisers and wrote to many people, including businessmen and politicians regarding Power the Children. Fast forward a few months, and the project had managed to purchase a block of land and construction had begun. I followed up on a second trip in November, where my love for Tanzania grew even more. Again fast forward to January, 2020, thanks to everyone, particularly Dayna Roy and Leena Vasista, we all returned to Arusha to attend an opening ceremony, and decide where we were to go next. This trip was a catalyst for ‘The Powers Project’ as despite the success of the project, we did encounter some issues, and were able to learn a lot about working on projects when abroad. Through continued commitment, and a shared passion for the project, ‘The Powers Project Foundation’ was established. One constant which always remains when learning about the differences in culture overseas, learning about ‘good development’ and working on non for profit based projects, is that education will always remain perhaps the most important element of any society.</p>
        <p>Through all of this I have now got friends from around the world, a project which allows me to work overseas and the most incredible, fun memories. Tanzania has stolen my heart! The Powers Project Foundation now works towards the ideology of advancing education in a range of communities around the world, by providing safe, and practical learning spaces, with a focus on sustainability and teaching towards each particular culture's wants and needs.</p>
