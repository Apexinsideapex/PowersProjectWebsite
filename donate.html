        <h4> Leena Vasishta </h4>
        <p>Mambo! My Name is Leena Vasishta, I am not very good at writing about myself so I'll just narrate a story.</p>
        <p>I volunteered at the Power the Children foundation from December 2018 - Feb 2019 and it absolutely changed my life. From stepping off the plane to being welcomed with open arms into Paskalina’s life and home was amazing. 
          I was blown away by how friendly and giving the community was.
          </p>
          <p>A typical day would be something like this:
            We would head to Mbauda in the morning, we would then be greeted by Paskalina at the door with the warmest hug and she would sit us down and brew us this delicious ginger tea. We would start planning our day and going over our to-do lists. We would then head into the classrooms and be greeted by the huge grins of our children. The next few hours would be spent engaging with them using interactive learning techniques and teaching them a little English as well. Few days a week we would head out to the new school and get some things done. We would end each day extremely exhausted, but with cheek to cheek grins and full hearts. 
            </p>
            <p>
              My time in Africa was an emotional rollercoaster. My heart has never been as full as it is on this beautiful continent. There have been lows as well, and the lows can be so devastating but they end up giving us more purpose and making us work harder towards our goals. I learnt a lot of lessons here. 
I was left with feeling very grateful about my life, but also slightly envious of this beautiful community that I’d been welcomed into, and that I would soon be leaving.

I came here slightly nervous and not really knowing what to expect, and left with an extremely heavy heart, but having added many more members to my family.

            </p>
            <p>I am a big believer in education being a very important part of the foundation of a child. This is exactly what we hope to achieve through The Powers Project. We are aiming to make education more accessible to young kids, so we can set them up to lead a full, successful life.
